# Embedded trip computer
An embedded trip computer to help people  monitor details about their vehicles

## Features
This project is an on-board computer, specifically a GUI-based computer.
Built on the STM32F746g-discovery board, this system simulates a real on-board computer, monitoring analog values such as
battery voltage, engine speed, fuel level and oil level.
It has a man-machine interface, developed from the TouchGFX framework.
The system runs on top of the FreeRTOS real-time operating system, and was compiled on the STM32CubeIDE.
